=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a role to describes a Numeric value.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item C<to>

Takes another number as argument and produces an array ranging from
the number the method is called on to the number given as argument. In
some situations, this method intentionally behaves different from the
range operator in perl:

  $foo = [ 5 .. 1 ]; # $foo is []

  $foo = 5->to(1);   # $foo is [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ]
